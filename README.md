To increase sales from the bottom 10 customers, the company should focus on building stronger relationships through personalized engagement. This could include tailored promotions based on purchasing behavior, direct outreach via calls or emails to understand their past experiences, and offering discounts on items they frequently view or have previously purchased. Upselling and cross-selling relevant products, providing faster delivery, enhanced after-sales support, and assigning dedicated account managers—especially for small business clients—can also make a difference. Finally, conducting surveys to uncover their needs, motivations for returning, and reasons for reduced activity will help create more effective retention strategies.

5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

![Returneditems](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad0f458f-2781-4620-99b9-a892696b0876)

11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.

![Ques11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256bcbe1-ab5f-489c-b23d-79fd6cf7c648)

From the findings above, KMS did not allocate shipping resources effectively according to order priority. Delivery trucks—typically suited for bulk or non-urgent shipments were overused, while express air, which is designed for time-sensitive deliveries, was underutilized. This mismatch between shipping mode, speed, and priority led to inefficient spending and unnecessary costs.
