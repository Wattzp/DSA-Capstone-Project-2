To increase sales from the bottom 10 customers, the company should focus on building stronger relationships through personalized engagement. This could include tailored promotions based on purchasing behavior, direct outreach via calls or emails to understand their past experiences, and offering discounts on items they frequently view or have previously purchased. Upselling and cross-selling relevant products, providing faster delivery, enhanced after-sales support, and assigning dedicated account managers—especially for small business clients—can also make a difference. Finally, conducting surveys to uncover their needs, motivations for returning, and reasons for reduced activity will help create more effective retention strategies.
